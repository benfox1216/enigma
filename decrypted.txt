paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. many students define paragraphs in
terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph
is half a page long, etc. in reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas
among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. a paragraph is defined as “a
group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (lunsford and connors
116). length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
paragraph. for instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic
styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. ultimately, a paragraph is a
sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. in this handout, we
will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens
in the rest of the paragraph.
